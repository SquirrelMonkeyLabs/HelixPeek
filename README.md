   From the dropdown menu, click on "Your DNA Results Summary" to go to your main DNA dashboard.
4. Click on "Settings"
   On the DNA Results Summary page, click the "Settings" button near the top right.
5. Scroll down to "Download Raw DNA Data"
   On the Settings page, scroll down until you find the "Download Raw DNA Data" section.

   This link will take you to a secure page where you can download your raw DNA data as a ZIP file.
10. Save the ZIP file to your computer
    Choose a location on your computer to save the file. Once downloaded, unzip it to view or use the raw data.

Q: I did a heritage test on another site. Will the app still work?
A: Probably not. However, if you send me a snippet of your raw data file (you can change the numbers and letters), I can take a look at how it's structured and possibly adapt the program.

Q: What do I need to use HelixPeek?
A: Python and the libraries in the top of the py file.

Q: I'm a biology nerd and would love to help with your hobby project!
Yes, please!

Q: Why is it still a beta version?
A: The program has only been tested with a few raw DNA files. There might still be bugs. If you're unsure about the results, you can click "Include rsID & genotype" to verify the information yourself. This will display the rsID and genotype, for example: (rsID: rs1426654, Genotype: AA).

Q: How many traits does it analyze?
A: The current version checks 113 traits, but that number could increase. Bookmark this site — we’ll definitely be releasing updates in the future.
